Sydney Selch is a graphic designer from Ottawa, Ontario who loves making things beautiful. I love taking something old or broken and contrasting it with something new and elegant to create something with an eclectic flair and interesting details. 

I specialize in print design, branding and UI/UX design. 
This is a porfolio website that displays my work and was coded and designed by myself to display my technical skills.
